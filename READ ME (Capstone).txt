Business Problem:
A local coffee shop named "Blended" located here in our 
province, Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya, has been experiencing inventory problems. With
me being friends with the owner of the said coffee shop, I thought that it would be a
perfect way to solve their inventory problem by creating a software that would help the workers or
the manager of Blended in storing the data of their inventory. 

**Also include/download the pythontut file that serves as the database.**
